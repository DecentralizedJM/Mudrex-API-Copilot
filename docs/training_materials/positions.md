The Positions section lets you monitor and manage your open and past trades.  You can fetch all current open positions along with their entry price, quantity, leverage and unrealised P&L; set or update stop‑loss and take‑profit orders; reverse a position; close part of a position; and retrieve your closed position history.  Each sub‑page addresses a different aspect of position management.
