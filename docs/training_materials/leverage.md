---

The Leverage section deals with how much borrowing power you apply to your trades.  Endpoints here allow you to query the current leverage and margin type (isolated) for a given asset, and to set a new leverage value.  Setting leverage affects the buying power of future orders on that asset; positions already opened remain unchanged.  Explore the sub‑pages to get and set leverage settings.
