The Orders section covers the entire lifecycle of futures orders.  Use these endpoints to place new market or limit orders, view your open orders, retrieve individual order details, view historical orders, and cancel existing orders.  You can also specify reduce‑only orders to ensure they only close or reduce positions.  Refer to the sub‑pages for specifics on each operation.
