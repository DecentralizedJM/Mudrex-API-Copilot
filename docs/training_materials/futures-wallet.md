---

The Futures Wallet section lets you see how much margin you have available for futures trading.  It exposes a single endpoint to fetch your current futures wallet balance, the amount locked in open positions or orders, and a flag indicating whether you are a first‑time futures user.  If you need to move money into or out of your futures wallet, use the transfer endpoint under the Wallet section.
