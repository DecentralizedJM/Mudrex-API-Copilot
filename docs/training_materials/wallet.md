The Wallet section provides endpoints to interact with your spot wallet.  You can retrieve your current spot balance and move funds between your spot and futures wallets.  Use these APIs to check how much you have available to invest, withdraw, or transfer, and to manage your capital allocation between spot and futures trading.  See the sub‑pages for fetching balances and initiating transfers.
